        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This lab included setting up the bluetooth module on the Artemis board and running it
          using Jupyter Notebook. 
        </p>
        
        <h2>Setup</h2>

        <h2>Tasks</h2>

        <h3>Echo Command</h3>

        <h3>Sending three floats</h3>
        <p>Sending three floats to the Artemis board required using the SEND_THREE_FLOATS 
        commmand. I used the provided SEND_TWO_INTS method as a guide for this function.  
        </p>

        <h3>Setting up notification handler in Python</h3>
        <p>The Artemis board is going to send a float value to the computer for processing. 
        The function notif_handler stores the float as a global variable upon receiving it.
        I chose to make it a volatile variable, this way as soon as it is updated, the variable
        is updated in memory. Then when it's necessary to read the variable back, it is fetched
        from memory so it is always up to date. I'm assuming we don't have to worry about atomicity
        with this function call. 
        </p>
        <h3>The difference between Approach 1 and Approach 2</h3>
        <p>Approach 1: Receive a float value in Python using receive_float() on a characteristic that is 
        defined as BLEFloatCharactersitic in the Arduino side </p>
        <p>Approach 2: Receive a float value in Python using receive_string() (and subsequently converting
        it to a float type in Python) on a characteristic that is defined as a BLECStringCharacteristic in
        the Arduino side.</p>
