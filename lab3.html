        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> This lab is about setting up the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and 
        Time of Flight (TOF) sensors. 
        </p>
        <h2>Prelab</h2>
        <h3> ToF Sensor Address </h3>
        <p>The ToF sensor, VL53L1X, has a hardwired address. I chose to
        programmatically change the address of the sensor upon startup
        rather than enable two sensors separately through their shutdown pins.
        This was mostly because I didn't want the hassle of dealing with
        mutual exclusion. I figured that trying to read from two sensors
        with the same address at the same time would be a lot like dealing
        with locks for processes that cannot run simultaneously. In all 
        honesty, I am just not that good at keeping track of multiple things, 
        so for me, as the designer and user of this robot, it was easier to 
        program a separate address for one of the sensors.
        </p>
        <p> I understand that a downside is that if there is a power issue, 
        the sensor address reverts to its default. I hope that is an unlikely
        event, or at least won't occur while I am using the robot, so I'm 
        comfortable taking that risk. 
        </p>
        <h3>ToF Sensor Placement on Robot and Possible Scenarios</h3>
        <p> During lecture the day that we discussed this, my friend and I 
        decided that it would be smart to mount the sensors at the front
        and back of the car. To me this is kind of like having a reverse camera 
        in a car, and a person driving it seeing forward.
        </p>
        <p> In a scenario where the user wanted to navigate a series of obstacles 
        in a classroom, or lab, the only visual data that matters is that
        the car can physically fit in that space. Therefore, a front-mounted 
        sensor placed at the top rim of the car would guarantee that there is space 
        in front of the car to move forward, and since the car is so low to the ground, 
        it is very unlikely that anything below the sensor will be blocking the car's 
        path. It doesn't matter that we can't sense what's above the car's height, because 
        it won't hit our car anyway.
        </p>
        <p> The sensor in the back would be for maneuvering better. 
        Just like some cars have a reverse camera, it would be helpful to 
        have this raw data to know where it is possible to turn and move in 
        reverse. It would also make it easier to track distances. Imagine 
        a scenario in which the starting line of the car is in front of a wall 
        and it has to make it to the other side of the room as fast as possible. 
        Having a ToF sensor on the back would allow you to track how far you've 
        traveled, and therefore how much more you have to go.
